## About
Endshards is a mod for those players who are bored in the endgame.
Sure, building has its appeal, but you want challenge! Adventure!
Well, you need not look further. Endshards extends the late game by
making it more difficult to acquire equipment beyond diamond, each set
requiring you to defeat a boss. This includes the existing Netherite,
which will require defeating the Wither. If that seems a bit mean,
don't worry, Netherite and the new equipment added by Endshards all have
special abilities to make your gameplay more fun!

Finally, Endshards will add a new dimension, the Nightmare Realm, somewhat
inspired by the Spirit World from Witchery. This new dimension is still
in the works, and even I don't know what will be in it yet, but I can promise
a variety of biomes and an exciting new boss fight!

# Netherite Equipment
Upgrading to Netherite Equipment will require a piece of Diamond Equipment, an Infused Netherite Ingot, and of course, a Netherite Upgrade smithing template. These templates can be found with in Bastion Remnant chests. It might be wise to make a copy using a diamond and some End Stone before applying it...

## Netherite Armor
Netherite Armor will provide a Resistance III effect for 10 seconds when one of these conditions are met:
- The player is below half health
- The player takes damage that would drop them below half health

The effect has a 60-second cooldown, so those 10 seconds should probably be used to escape.

## Netherite Sword
The Netherite Sword lights all mobs in a 10 block radius on fire for 10 seconds on a 30-second cooldown. This is enough to kill any animals without dealing any prior damage, making it great for collecting food.

As with Ender Equipment, the cooldown is shared between the armor and sword. Take care not to use your offensive abilities when defense is more strongly needed.

## Netherite Tools
Netherite Tools autosmelt mined items.

# Sculk Equipment
Upgrading to Sculk Equipment will require a piece of Diamond Equipment, an Infused Sculk Gem, and of course, a Sculk Upgrade smithing template. These templates can be found with a 10% chance in Ancient City chests. It might be wise to make a copy using a diamond and some Sculk before applying it...

## Sculk Armor
Sculk Armor provides permanent Night Vision. No drawbacks. Neat, huh?

## Sculk Sword
The Sculk Sword will turn simple mobs into "Thralls" which fight for you. There is a limit of 3 thralls at once, and 10-second cooldown between making thralls. Only "simple-minded" mobs such as undead and spiders can become thralls. Thralls are not persistent and can despawn, but they will follow you. Think of them more as a useful tool to distract enemies in a pinch than a faithful companion like a dog. Thralls will, however, remain yours between world loads (unless they despawn due to being on a server).

In addition to making Thralls, the Sculk Sword also allows collection of [Soul Fragments](../materials/drops.md#soul-fragment) and [Phantom Soul Fragments](../materials/drops.md#phantom-soul-fragment).

## Sculk Tools
Sculk Tools have a chance to drop 1XP when breaking non-ore blocks. It's not quite enough to sustain a tool with Mending, but good help either way.

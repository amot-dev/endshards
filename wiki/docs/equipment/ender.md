# Ender Equipment
Upgrading to Ender Equipment will require a piece of Diamond Equipment, an Infused Ender Ingot, and of course, an Ender Upgrade smithing template. These templates can be found with a 10% chance in End City chests. It might be wise to make a copy using a diamond and some End Stone before applying it...

## Ender Armor
Ender Armor negates all fall damage, on a 30-second cooldown.

## Ender Sword
The Ender Sword can be used to right-click on a mob to teleport it the void, on a 60-second cooldown. Note that this cooldown is shared between the armor and sword. Forgetting this could lead to an unfortunate fall. Certain mobs are immune to being teleported by the sword (End mobs, minibosses, and bosses). 

## Ender Tools
Ender Tools warp items mined directly to the player's inventory. This is incredibly effective when mining [Strange Crystals](../materials/ores.md#strange-crystals) in the End.

# Nightmare Realm (Future Content)
The Nightmare Realm is the culmination of the Endshards mod. A new dimension full of new and exciting mobs, plus some stronger, scarier vanilla mobs. It is accessed in a few ways, but primarily by placing a [Phantom Soul Fragment](../materials/drops.md#phantom-soul-fragment) under your pillow, then sleeping. You can place a fragment by right-clicking the bed (yes, you can grief people's beds ðŸ˜ƒ).

You bring your inventory with you into the Nightmare Realm, but Remnants of the Realm (items native to the Nightmare Realm) will stay behind when you leave. They are safe if placed in a chest but gone forever if left in your inventory.

Upon nearly dying, you "wake up" from the Nightmare Realm. Time has passed in the Overworld, but it's still night. When it turns day in the Overworld, you "wake up" from the Nightmare Realm. It is morning in the Overworld. It may be useful to bring a clock so you know when this will happen, preventing item loss.

There is more detailed info on the other pages in this section. Please keep in mind that this is all future content and not in the mod yet.

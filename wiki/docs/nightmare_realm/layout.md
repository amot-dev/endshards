The Nightmare Realm is split into 7 dimensions. A player can initially spawn in any of the first 6 dimensions, and should be prepared for those threats before venturing into the Realm. Dimension borders can be traversed via portals that are found scattered through each of the dimensions. The portal destination is random, but remains constant (if you find a portal from Frostburn to The Silence, you can be certain all portals from Frostburn will lead to The Silence). Portals can be broken, leaving just an empty frame. This is useful for forced exits or for summoning a [Gate of Terror](gate_of_terror.md), which is used to enter the 7th dimension. Here is a list of all 7 dimensions, in order of danger:

- Frostburn
- The Forest of Eternal Darkness

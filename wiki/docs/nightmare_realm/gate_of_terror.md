# Gate of Terror
The Nightmare Realm is split into 7 dimensions. 6 of these contain an item needed to progress through the Gate of Terror and reach the [Terror Guardian](terror_guardian.md), in the final dimension. The Gate of Terror must be summoned into an existing portal frame. To summon the gate:

1. Place an Amplifying Pedestal in front of the empty portal
2. Slot the Tome of Terror (crafted from Possessed Paper and Leather? like a normal book)
3. Use Sentient Ink on the Tome of Terror
4. Wait for the Sentient Ink to write some evil spells
5. Place an Attuning Gemstone on the front of the Amplifying Pedestal
6. Sound the Horn of the Ancients to shatter the Attuning Gemstone and release unbalanced energy into the empty portal

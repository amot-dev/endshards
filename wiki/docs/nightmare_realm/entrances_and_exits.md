# Entrances and Exits
## Natural Entrances
- A natural entrance into the Realm will force its effects onto you
  - You will not be able to leave of your own volition
  - You will not be able to bring back items belonging to the Realm
  - You will be kicked out when your sleep ends
- Placing a [Phantom Soul Fragment](../materials/drops.md#phantom-soul-fragment) under your pillow, then sleeping, is considered a natural entrance
  - This will return you to your last location in the Realm, or the beginning of the Realm, based on your exit

## Forced Entrances
- A forced entrance into the Realm will have unexpected effects
  - You will be able to leave at choice and stay as long as you want
  - You may be able to bring back items belonging to the Realm
  - Certain entities will not notice your presence, while others will be enraged at your trespass
    - This is random, but dependent on the type of entity. Lower entities are more likely to not notice you, while higher entities are more likely to notice you
    - You do not want to be noticed
    - Wearing or using items not native to the Realm make you more noticeable
    - While significantly dimmer and more expensive, Nightmare Fuel Torches are better than regular torches
    - Similarly, Nightmare Armor > No Armor > Overworld Armor
- Pricking yourself on a Demonic Obelisk to light a Blood Portal is considered a forced entrance

## Natural Exits
- A natural exit can only occur after a natural entrance, leaving them very linked
  - All remnants of the Nightmare Realm in your inventory will be wiped
    - These remnants are NOT retrievable. Ensure they are stored in a safe location before dawn. A clock will track the time in the overworld and is highly recommended!
  - You will exit at your entrance location
  - Your position in the Realm is maintained, and you will return there when you next enter
- Waking up in the morning is the only possible natural exit

## Forced Exits
- A forced exit, like a forced entrance, can have unexpected effects
  - You will keep your entire inventory, including remnants of the Nightmare Realm
  - You will exit at your entrance location
  - Your position in the Realm is maintained, and you will return there when you next enter
- Manifesting a portal in an exit gate is considered a forced exit
  - This requires significant willpower (not an actual in-game stat)
  - You will have enough willpower if you entered by force or have just defeated the [Terror Guardian](terror_guardian.md)
  - With enough willpower, a portal will automatically form in the gate

## Panic Exits
- A panic exit can cause dire consequences and should be avoided at all costs
  - This occurs if you take too much damage in the Nightmare Realm
  - Upon reaching 1HP (half heart), survival instincts increase your willpower enough to rip a portal out
    - Without an exit gate to stabilize this portal, there are severe consequences
    - This portal is large, chaotic, and very loud to the native entities of the Realm, which causes a few things to happen:
      - Your inventory will be scattered on the floor when you exit (save of course, remnants of the Realm)
      - You will have nausea
      - You will still be on 1HP
      - Within the next 10 seconds, some entities will follow you into the overworld. You can die here!
  - You will exit at your entrance location
  - Your position in the Realm is lost

# Infusion
Infusion is the process of combining a metal or gem with the essence of a powerful creature. Ender Ingots, Netherite Ingots, Sculk Gems, and Nightmare Pearls all need to be infused with their respective essence before they can be used to craft equipment.

## Infusion Cores
Infusion Cores are mediums that hold the power of great entities. They can be used to infuse refined items with power, giving them a glow. An Infusion Core can be crafted with 4 Obsidian in the corners, 4 Diamonds on the sides, and Glass in the middle.

Infusion Cores are reusable! Infusing a refined item with a filled Infusion Core will return an empty core.

## Process
Each Infusion needs 3 cores and one item of power. An Ender Ingot needs to be infused with the Essence of Dragon. The dragon's item of power is Dragon's Breath, so crafting 3 empty cores with a Dragon's Breath will yield 3 cores infused with the Essence of Dragon. Then, one Infusion Core (Essence of Dragon) can be combined with one Ender Ingot to craft an Ender Ingot (Infused).

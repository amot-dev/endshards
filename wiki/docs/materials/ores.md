## Strange Crystals
Strange Crystals generate randomly in the End, specifically under the end islands. They are rare-ish, usually you can find 2-3 per island. They drop an [Endshard](drops.md#endshard) when broken with a Diamond Pickaxe or better ...somewhere in a 16x16x16 area around the player ðŸ˜ƒ. Fret not, it will land on a block, similar to when a player eats Chorus Fruit.

## Ancient Debris
Ancient Debris is still found in the depths of the Nether, however, it now requires at least an [Ender Pickaxe](../equipment/ender.md) to mine.

## Soul-Infused Sculk
Soul-Infused Sculk generates randomly within Sculk blocks. They can spawn in any Deep Dark biome, but it's easiest to find them in Ancient Cities. They are very rare, perhaps 4-10 per cityâ€”if you can find them. They also blend in very well with the Sculk. I recommend a Night Vision potion. Breaking one with a [Netherite Hoe](../equipment/netherite.md) or better drops a [Soul Fragment](drops.md#soul-fragment).
